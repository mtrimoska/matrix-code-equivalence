# The Matrix Code Equivalence Problem
This repository contains implementations of algorithms for solving the Matrix Code Equivalence problem (MCE).

These algorithms are a result of joint work with [Krijn Reijnders](https://krijnreijnders.com/) and [Simona Samardjiska](https://samardjiska.org/). See our paper: [Hardness estimates of the Code Equivalence Problem in the Rank Metric](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/276)

! Under construction !
Code coming up soon.
